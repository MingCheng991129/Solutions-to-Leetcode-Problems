I have given 4 solutions but none of them has the low time complexity.

Then I Googled it and learnt the 5th solution, which is *Floyd Cycle Detection Algorithm*.

**Solution 1** sorts the array.

**Solution 2** doesn't change the array but uses nested loop.

**Solution 3** uses hashmap.

**Solution 4** uses another data structure: set.

**Solution 5** uses the **Floyd Cycle Detection Algorithm**.

The result of all of the 5 solutions are:

**Solution 1:**
Runtime: 16 ms, faster than 31.89% of C++ online submissions for Find the Duplicate Number.
Memory Usage: 9.9 MB, less than 82.50% of C++ online submissions for 
    Find the Duplicate Number.
    
    
**Solution 2:**
Runtime: 552 ms, faster than 5.04% of C++ online submissions for 
        Find the Duplicate Number.
         Memory Usage: 9.8 MB, less than 97.50% of C++ online submissions for 
         Find the Duplicate Number.
         
**Solution 3:**
Runtime: 16 ms, faster than 31.89% of C++ online submissions for 
        Find the Duplicate Number.
         Memory Usage: 11.6 MB, less than 5.00% of C++ online submissions for 
         Find the Duplicate Number.

**Solution 4:**
Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 10.21% of C++ online submissions for 
        Find the Duplicate Number.
         Memory Usage: 11.6 MB, less than 5.00% of C++ online submissions for 
        Find the Duplicate Number.

**Solution 5:**
Runtime: 8 ms, faster than 97.52% of C++ online submissions for Find the Duplicate Number.
Memory Usage: 9.8 MB, less than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for Find the Duplicate Number.
