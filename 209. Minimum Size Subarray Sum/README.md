Solution 1 uses brute force, with time complexity as O(n<sup>3</sup>).
This solution is *Time Limit Exceeded* in this case.

Solution 2 uses two pointers, with time complexity as O(n).

There also exists a solution using binary tree and I will update that solution later.

The question is shown below:
