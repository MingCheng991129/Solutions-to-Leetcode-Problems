In my opinion, this question is a little complex...I use two pointers and an array to store the reversed elements.

However, my method doesn't take "m == 1" into consideration at the beginning and I debug for lots of time to solve this problem.

I think there must be other methods through which I don't need to debug a lot for the situation "m == 1".

The question is shown below:
