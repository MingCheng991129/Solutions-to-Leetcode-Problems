Notice that if k % len == 0 (len is the length of list), we just need to return the original list without doing any modification.

Solution 2 is better than solution 1, but is still time-wasting..

Submission result of solution 2:
Runtime: 204 ms, faster than 7.54% of C++ online submissions for Rotate List.
Memory Usage: 9.6 MB, less than 7.14% of C++ online submissions for Rotate List.
