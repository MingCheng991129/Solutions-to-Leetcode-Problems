**Solution 1**

The procedure of solution 1 is shown as below:

1. Define an array *arr*, with the nth element as **number of BST when input is n.** 
Note that arr[0] = 1, arr[1] = 1.

2. When n >= 2, [1, n - 1] must be the left children of the final BST and [n + 1, âˆž) must be the right children.

3. Therefore, arr[n] = arr[0]\*arr[n - 1] + arr[1]\*arr[n - 2] +... + arr[n - 1]\*arr[0]
