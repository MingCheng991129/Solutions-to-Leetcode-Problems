The question is shown below:

**Solution 1:**

Use two loops to find the two indexes, which is easy to understand.

time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)

space complexity: O(1)


**You cannot sort the input array because it will break the original index.**

Of course, there exists another solution using hashmap (unordered_map in STL) and I haven't tried yet. Maybe later I will try that one and update this folder.
