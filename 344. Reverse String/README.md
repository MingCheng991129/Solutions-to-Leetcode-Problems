To solve this problem, I use two pointers and just swap the corresponding values until the iteration ends.

time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(1)

Runtime: 52 ms, faster than 46.15% of C++ online submissions for Reverse String.
Memory Usage: 15.1 MB, less than 98.78% of C++ online submissions for Reverse String.

The question is shown below:
