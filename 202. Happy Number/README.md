**The key to this question is that: whatever a number is, there does exist a cycle. If the number is happy, then it cycles by 1; if not,

Solution 1 uses a hashmap to judge whether a number has existed or not.

Solution 2 uses *two pointers* method, with space complexity as O(1).

The question is shown below:
